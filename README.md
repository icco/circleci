# circleci

An image for using in Circle CI 2.0 Docker Executor based on Jessie.

You can read through the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/icco/circleci/blob/master/Dockerfile) to understand everything this is doing. The general idea is a build image with everything you could possibly need to build your app.

This is hosted on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/icco/circleci/).
